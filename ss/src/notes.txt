DONE fp Sun Feb 10 08:36:34 2019
- typecheck.sml ()({r}) == ({r+1}) in type equality now
- avoid spurious eta-expansion in time reconstruction

DONE fp Tue Feb  5 08:51:09 2019
- pprint.sml and clients
  eliminated abbreviation code and pp_tp_short.  Use pp_tp_compact

DONE fp Mon Feb  4 21:44:54 2019
- trecon-bt.sml, trecon-util.sml, elab.sml
  added backtracking time reconstruction, which is run as a separate
  (redundant) pass after synthesizing reconstruction.  -v will print success
  message.  Printing statistics for backtracking reconstruction with -v.

DONE fp Wed Jan 30 21:32:46 2019
- trecon.sml - improved statistics, avoided building redundant reconstructions,
               picking smallest possible reconstruction

DONE fp Tue Jan 29 11:03:58 2019
- elab.sml - changed some occs of 'vs' to 'ctx' 
- parser.sml - synchronized name of nonterminals in readme.txt with parsing function names
- typecheck.sml - edited decrement{L,R} and eventually{box,dia} to make quantifiers and work structural 
- typecheck.sml - edited function 'contractive' to allow box and dia (but not Next)

DONE ad Tue Jan 29
- *recon.sml - 'prime' the reconstruction functions in the order they are called 
- *recon.sml - add 'ctx' and 'con' to all reconstructions functions
- *recon.sml - change 'wrecon' to 'recon'
- {w,t}recon.sml - should we avoid inserting work{0}, for example?

DONE fp Tue Jan 29 18:08:11 2019
- pprint.sml - fixed pp_exp and pp_exp_prefix to take environment so it
               can print embedded types
- elab.sml - allow both work and time reconstruction on the same source
             and added some regressions (tests/transducers*.ss)
DONE fp Sun Jan 27 09:43:10 2019
Complete pass
- added comments
- re-ordered data types and unified order of branches
- orders of functions in files
- improved (some) error messages
- improved pretty printing (to some extent...)
- eliminated all direct calls to Ast.Print.*
- reviewed changes to *recon

TODO (including exchanges, in reverse chronological order)

FRANK

POSTPONE: GENERAL - allow constraints in type equality assertions?
Q: typecheck.sml - catch temporal types that are illegal for reconstruction early,  
    during the validity check  NO, leave as is  
Q: {q,w}recon.sml - how to unify the various must/may look-aheads in quantifier 
   and work reconstruction?

Refactor to introduce action prefix in the
abstract syntax?

======================================================================

- Refactor typecheck.sml into elab.sml, typecheck.sml,
  and recon.sml, with two versions of recon (until
  it is fixed).  Already have a simplified version of
  reconstruction in recon.sml.  Also, maybe new file
  with type primitives used by checking and reconstruction

Check that all process are defined before execution?
(see tests/undef.ss)
Do this in typecheck.sml, maybe also recon.sml
