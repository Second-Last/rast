\section{Introduction}
Statically expressing and verifying the specifications of
programs is an important problem which has received significant
attention in the past. However, most of the tools and techniques
addressing this challenge have been designed for sequential
systems. This is in sharp contrast with the need for programming
language support for distributed and concurrent systems which
are increasingly pervasive and particularly difficult to analyze.
For instance, the interactive nature of messsage-passing systems
makes it difficult to decompose the system into individual parts
that can be analyzed in isolation. Distributed systems also suffer
from deadlocks and read-write overheads due to shared memory
further complicating the verification of their intended purpose.

Session types provide a structured and compositional way of
prescribing communication protocols of message-passing systems.
