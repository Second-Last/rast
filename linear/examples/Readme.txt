Current status

Todo
- stacks and stack-based computation (idx, but not work, currently does not compile)
- Turing machine encodings
- modular arithmetic (idx, time, but not work, just ss)

Done
. various list processing, and queues (idx, some with work) 
. binary arithmetic (idx, time, but not work, just ss) 
. integers as pairs of natural numbers (idx, not work)
. linear lambda-calculus (idx, not work, quant)
. prime sieve (idx, not yet work)
. list segments (idx, work, quant)
. tries to represent multiset of integers (idx, work, quant)
. balanced ternary representation for integers (idx, time, but not work, just ss) 
. some arithmetic theorems, proofs expressed as processes (idx, but not work, just ss)
